I've become a slave to outcomes,  
Some expected,  
Some engineered to happen.  
My day runs like an estimation problem:  
I search for the best parameters,  
I search for the best people;  
For gaps to fit in,  
For perforations to soak into  
Backed by the illusion of need  
Seconded by a veil of fulfilment  
That would supplant what I have lost.  

With my desires stationed at the cockpit,  
Decisions braised at traffic control,  
I've been fairly successful.  
Built bridges over oceans,  
Built canals over mountains;  
I've been my own puppeteer,  
Applause guiding my movement,  
Appraisal calling the tune of my words.  

I don't want me to be that puppeteer  
I'd want me to be,  
Like a snake charmer  
Who does it solely to amuse the snake;  
Like a contortionist  
Who does it solely to spite chiropractors;  
Like an astrologer  
Who does it solely to screw over strangers;  

I write this because I can,  
Not to create an aphorism:  
I'd want me to be, because I can,  
Not to run an agenda of determinism.
