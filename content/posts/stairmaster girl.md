as time stood still,  
when she walked past me,  
my eyes disobeyed,  
and walked with her.  
my nostrils long to surf  
the waves that wash ashore  
onto a face so precious,  
with lips so red that they make me  
crave blood for breakfast,  
served on her plate, ridged and wet,  
flowing over mine, dry as winter.  

i’d start a life in a sauna heated  
from the mist of that heavy breath  
of hers, when she walks up those stairs  
that lead nowhere.  
to catch a glimpse of her smile  
is to fuse two atoms,  
and they’d still not burn me  
half as much as she does  
when those deep black eyes  
dart over me,  
and beyond me,  
leaving me undone.  

i’ve built a tomb around the memory  
of the first time i spoke with her.  
i protect, cherish, and worship it.  
i sing so many praises about someone i know so little of,  
that religion makes sense as i put her on my pedestal.
