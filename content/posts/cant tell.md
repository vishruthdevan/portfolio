Is she mine? I can't tell.  
Is she really mine, it hurts to dwell  
In this lightless mist of doubt, it hurts.  
Many days of despair have made me frail  
She's an obsession, my obsession  
An obsession that leads me, it guides me,  
Like the soft gentle notes of a piano  
Through the unlit streets of Manhattanville.  

The world wants her  
While she's in my arms  
Insomnia has consumed her,  
It's passed on to me.  
I dream of her as I walk up to her,  
I dream of her as I kiss her good night,  
I dream of us together when we are,  
I dream of us together when far apart.  

That lightless doubt glooms over the ones around her;  
Shining my flashlight of integrity has proved futile.  
She's smart, she can dance,  
She's got fragile hands but her legs make me immobile,  
Yet to someone so little, she is mine.  
I still can't tell.  
She speaks like the sound of raindrops  
Against the window on an evening when I was twelve.  

Jealousy is my companion;  
Anger engulfs me when she's herself without me.  
Her secrets gut me, yet she is mine.  
I'm helpless hoping she finds herself  
On a path with its apogee converging at my heart.  
I'm helpless hoping she treads that path,  
With her moisturized feet and a stuffy nose  
She's freed me from substance,  
Freed me from loneliness.  

Articulation has been a stranger to her  
When she desires to tell me how she feels.  
Yet I know, she is mine.  
But is she really? I can't tell.
