She could sigh to arouse the air around,  
Adorable, soft-spoken and sweet; I was bound  
Not to her, but to the thought of us together.  
Could this never be? My mind was unsound.  
How should I know, what I had fallen for?  
Angels and enchantresses bore no distinction here  
Nevertheless, I returned home, with her fragrance on my hand,  
After all, though I was hers, she will never be mine.
