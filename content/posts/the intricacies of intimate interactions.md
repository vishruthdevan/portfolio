Don't get too comfortable, why should you be?  
These words must be violent, they're to set her free;  
Free from her thoughts and free from ennui,  
Free from this desert of a chat history.  

If you can do this, momentarily,  
Don't pass the baton way too early;  
You're painting a picture of what might be,  
Paint the leaves, the twigs and the roots of this tree.  

This painting will take her to the edge of sanity,  
Speak now as you wish, your minds are hazy.  
It's time to enjoy the fruit of your fulfiled duty,  
Because best believe, my brother, you'd be going crazy.
