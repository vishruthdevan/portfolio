You returned, right on time.  
I heard you drown the bassline in my ears.  
There's little left in my world  
That can spoil the quiet joy of a late sunset.  

"There's little left in your world," you whispered  
"Notes don't please you like voices do."  
You're right, and I missed you.  
Unwelcome as you are, you have a voice nonetheless.  

I left you back home, only to be haunted now  
You are unsettling, yet comforting.  
It surprises me when your voice begins to fade,  
Like the outline of my shadow at dusk.  

And before I could see your silhouette,  
You shrouded the last hint of light.  
I drag you along with me now,  
Until I can outrun you again.
