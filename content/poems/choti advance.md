Houdini would be jealous  
Of how better an escapist I am,  
When the letters 'Marlboro' part my lips;  
Of how I can disappear into myself.  
The crisp current of Coonoor breeze seems fowl  
When pit against the yellow tar, the coarse air.  
My trachea isn’t as forgiving  
As I am to myself when I let  
The acrid breath of worry out my mouth.  

The flame to the fuse  
Is rather the flame to diffuse.  
The first few puffs are like the comfort  
You would find in a consulting room  
Problems diminish while they remain  
As belittling as what’s left of the ember  
Holding on helplessly knowing that I will let it go.  
The best cup of tea is nauseatingly unsavoury;  
I reflect on the disappointment of my taste buds.  

Upon that reflection doubt sets in.  
The smoldering ash is closing in on me;  
The world around me scales back down.  
I’m ensnared again in the room of revitalizing air,  
The delicate ribbons swirling around me  
Try their best to fight this entrapment.  
Their ability to dissolve, I envy;  
I become a blacksmith without a furnace.  
And the ash recovers and reintegrates,  

In the form of another cigarette  
That part my lips again.
