Loneliness can be brutal,  
And it is not always what people claim to feel  
For the void they feel is transient;  
Their feelings so slightly peeled.  

When their partners abandon them,  
Or by their neighbours, they are shunned;  
When their friends desert them,  
Or they lose their loved ones.  

But are they really lonely?  
When they always have an out;  
Some one or thing to pour their worries into  
To have their sorrows doused.  

This false feeling would pass  
For it is not loneliness, it is grief.  
They will never know what I feel  
To never share, but at times, receive.  

As faint as their sorrows, I am unseen.  
Neither loved nor unloved, neither here nor there,  
In this world of colour,  
I am grey, here and everywhere.
