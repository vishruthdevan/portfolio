If it isn't love, why does it feel so good?  
If it is love, what I feel now, have I misunderstood?  
I'll laugh with her, cry with her, I know that I would;  
But love her, and cherish her, I doubt if I should.  

Talking all day, talking all night, I've grown quite attached;  
In her eyes, I've dissolved; From my senses, I've detached.  
If I had to relive this day, a thousand times over,  
Each of those days, it'd be a struggle to not fall harder.  

When it's past two, she thinks not to, talk to me any longer.  
It starts off sweet, we talk about us, my freezing room gets warmer.  
Then I remember, to my misery, our non-existent future.  
We get too honest, my thoughts are in disarray, torture.  

It's the solstice, our propects together could certainly be brighter;  
The pearly moon fits this girl, I can't deny, she's a real wonder.  
Is what I have with her only ephemeral? I try to guess our fate;  
How could I be content knowing there's an expiry date?
