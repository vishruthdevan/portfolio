Derulo said, "If it ain't love, why does it feel so good?"  
If it is love, what I feel now, have I misunderstood?  
I'll laugh with her, and cry with her, I'm pretty sure I would;  
But live with her, and be with her, I'm not sure if I could.  

Texting all day, talking all night, I'm growing quite attached;  
No sleep tonight, lost in her eyes; from my senses, detached.  
If I had to, relive this day, a thousand times over,  
Each of those days, I'd be helpless, I'd only fall deeper.  

When it's past 2, she thinks not to, talk to me any longer.  
It starts off good, we talk about us, it makes our hearts warmer.  
Then I realize, or rather doubt, does this have a future?  
We get too honest, it gets too messy, torture.  

Tonight was bright, it's the solstice, a night like no other;  
It fits this girl, I cant deny, she's a real wonder.  
Is this ending? Will it persist? I try to guess our fate;  
This conclusion, I can't digest. Is there an expiry date?
