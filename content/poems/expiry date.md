Derulo said, "If it ain't love, why does it feel so good?"  
If it is love, what I feel now, is it misunderstood?  
I'll laugh with her, and cry with her, I'm pretty sure I would;  
But live with her, and be with her, I'm not sure if I could.  

Texting all day, talking all night, I'm growing quite attached;  
No sleep tonight, lost in her eyes; from my senses, detached.  
If I had to, relive this day, a thousand times over,  
Each of those days, I'd be helpless, falling harder and deeper.  

When it's past 2, she thinks not to, talk to me any longer.  
It starts off sweet, we talk about us, making our hearts warmer.  
Then I remember, to my misery, our non-existent future.  
We get too honest, it gets too messy, it gets worse than torture.  

Tonight was bright, it's the solstice, a night like no other;  
It fits this girl, I can't deny, she's a real wonder.  
Will it soon end? Will it persist? I try to guess our fate;  
This conclusion, I cannot digest, for there is an expiry date.
