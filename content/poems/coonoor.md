My first steps to my first high,  
Two decades went fleeting by.  
I gathered myself and my thoughts as I  
Prepared to say my final goodbye.  

Green hills and the chill breeze,  
Purple skies and the smell of rain;  
What I felt everyday, were now memories  
Only as memories, they will remain.  

A small town to a big city,  
Leaving this tiny band of people, a pity;  
This is a tale as old as time,  
To let it all go, I was disinclined.  

But such is life, I have to admit,  
And what comes next is quite obscure.  
I have made my peace with it;  
With love, from Coonoor.
