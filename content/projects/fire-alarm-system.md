A Fire Alarm System designed with Arduino technology to enhance fire detection capabilities. This system utilizes Gas and Temperature sensors to monitor environmental conditions and promptly identify potential fire hazards. The recorded data is seamlessly transmitted and displayed on an Android App, leveraging Firebase for secure and reliable data storage.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors gas levels and temperature for timely detection of potential fire incidents.

- **Android App Integration**: Utilizes a dedicated Android App to display real-time sensor data, ensuring accessibility and convenience for users.

- **Firebase Integration**: Records and stores data on Firebase, allowing users to access historical information and enabling remote monitoring.

## How It Works

1. Gas and temperature sensors collect data in real-time.
2. Arduino processes the sensor data.
3. Processed data is transmitted to the Android App.
4. Android App displays the data and sends it to Firebase for secure storage.

## Key Components

- **Arduino Board**: The heart of the system, responsible for data processing and sensor integration.
- **Gas Sensor**: Detects gases indicative of fire, contributing to early fire detection.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Monitors temperature changes, providing additional context for fire detection.
- **Android App**: Displays real-time data and alerts, creating a user-friendly interface for monitoring.
- **Firebase**: Cloud-based database for storing recorded data securely.
