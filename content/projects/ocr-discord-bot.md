OCR Discord Bot is a convenient tool that enables users to extract text from images directly within a Discord server using Tesseract OCR. This bot simplifies the process by eliminating the need to save images, upload them to a website, and then perform OCR on the contents.

## Usage

- Attach Image: In a Discord server where the bot is present, attach an image to a message.

- Run OCR Command: Type the command .ocr in the message.

- Receive Text Output: The bot processes the image using Tesseract OCR and sends the extracted text as output.
