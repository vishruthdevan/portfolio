**Software Engineer 1**  
Jan 2026 - Present | San Francisco (Remote) | Full-time

* Working on the agent memory service, the AI user interface, and complex financial reporting for private markets

**Artificial Intelligence Engineer Intern**  
Jun 2025 - Dec 2025 | San Francisco (Remote) | Full-time

* Crafted prompts for Q&A help agents and the intent router agent using Anthropic's guidelines for prompt engineering
* Added the ability to design and build tools using the factory pattern in the internal AI SDK for generating MCP servers and the tools served through them. Added custom middleware to handle business logic and context passing so other developers could focus solely on their agent logic
* Standardized the agent configuration system using the builder pattern, creating a clean, flat interface for handling hundreds of configuration options
* Built a client for agents to utilize Amazon Bedrock's Knowledge Base for retrieval-augmented generation
* Created a website crawler that harvests information from Juniper Square's public site, stores documents in S3, generates a Kendra GenAI index, and layers a Bedrock knowledge base on top. All services are deployed via Infrastructure as Code (IaC) on Kubernetes pods
* Configured customizable event streaming between agents, the intent router, and the frontend to ensure event-driven interactions
* Collaborated with a team during the company hackathon to develop a QA agent that leveraged Playwright network activity to auto-generate unit tests, supporting the movement of tests from end-to-end to unit-level testing as outlined by the testing pyramid. The project placed third in the competition  

## Arklex.AI

**Software Development Engineer Intern**  
May 2025 - Aug 2025 | New York | Full-time

* Contributed to the open-source Arklex framework by developing an agent component that integrates into its taskgraph, inspired by n8n.io-style node orchestration
* Implemented asynchronous voice assistant capabilities using Pipecat, integrating multiple TTS/STT providers (Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Cartesia)
* Integrated the voice assistant with Twilio to enable real-time AI assistant interactions over phone calls
* Created tools for clients to effortlessly integrate HubSpot CRM functionalities with the agent component, streamlining customer relationship management processes and enhancing overall productivity

## Columbia University

**Graduate Researcher @ CRIS Laboratory**
Jan 2025 - May 2025 | New York | Part-time

* Studied protein residue interactions in AlphaFold predictions to explore attention-weighted relationships across protein families
* Conducted Zipfian analysis of chemical "tokens" in attention space, applying power law characterization to ranked residue pairs
* Identified dominant interaction patterns (e.g., hydrophobic and charged pairs), revealing natural language-like distributions

**Teaching Assistant @ School of International and Public Affairs**
Jan 2025 - May 2025 | New York | Part-time

* Assisted Professor Sameer Maskey with the course Artificial Intelligence in Public Policy (INAFU6009), teaching AI fundamentals, including machine learning algorithms, data structures, and programming basics
* Mentored students through hands-on AI solution development, guiding them from problem identification to implementation using real-world datasets and open-source tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch
* Led discussions on AI ethics, governance, and policy implications, helping students critically analyze the societal impact of AI technologies
* Supported coursework by grading assignments, providing constructive feedback, and facilitating technical workshops on AI methodologies and tools

## Go Plus  

**Software Development Engineer**  
Oct 2023 - May 2024 | Ottawa (Remote)

* Built RESTful APIs for a Learning Management System using Django Rest Framework, facilitating test-taking, question creation, and study material management
* Developed and integrated an LLM Agent leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4, streamlining the process of generating 20 questions, from manual effort of one hour to a 3-minute serverless asynchronous task on Azure Functions
* Migrated infrastructure from AWS to Azure in one week with zero downtime, cutting costs by $6,000/month via Azure Startups Founders Hub credits. Transitioned key services (EC2 to Azure VMs, S3 to Blob Storage, RDS to Azure DB for PostgreSQL)
* Automated AWS infrastructure with Amazon CDK, reducing task time from 2 hours to 200 seconds. Used Terraform to deploy AKS clusters for efficient Azure service management

**Software Development Engineer Intern**  
Feb 2023 - Jul 2023 | Ottawa (Remote)

* Designed and implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run automated tests during deployment, reducing downtime from 14 minutes to 1 minute and significantly improving deployment speed and system reliability
* Integrated Stripe payments implementing webhooks to handle transactions in real time and manage payment events for the three types of payment plans available to customers

## Google Developers Student Clubs

**Developer & Core Committee Member**  
March 2022 – May 2024 | Vellore, India
