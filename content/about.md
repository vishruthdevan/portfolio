I'm Vishruth.

I live in New York now, but I used to live in Coonoor. I also spent time in Coimbatore, though Coonoor will always be home.

I’m pursuing my master’s in Computer Science at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I completed my bachelor’s at [VIT, Vellore](https://vit.ac.in/).

I worked as an AI Engineer Intern at [Juniper Square](httos://junipersquare.com/) during the summer of 2025 and will be continuing in the role through the fall. We’re building the first-of-its-kind multi-agent AI assistant for the private equity industry. I’m also part of the CRIS Lab and was a summer research fellow at the NLP Lab at Columbia. Before this, I worked as a Web Developer and DevOps Engineer at [Go Plus](https://go-plus.io/), where we built an AI-powered learning platform for higher education institutions.

I code, and you can find my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/vishruthdevan/). I’m also an AWS Certified Solutions Architect.

I’m a teaching assistant for Security 1 at Columbia and for NLP at Barnard. If you’re a student enrolled in these courses, you can reach me at [vd2461@columbia.edu](mailto:vd2461@columbia.edu).
