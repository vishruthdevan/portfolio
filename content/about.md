I'm Vishruth. I live in Coonoor, India.

I will be doing my master's in Computer Science in Columbia University. I did my bachelor's at [VIT, Vellore](https://vit.ac.in/)

I used to work as a Web Developer and a DevOps Engineer at [GoPlus Inc.](https://go-plus.io/) We were building an AI powered learning platform for higher education institutions. 

I code. You can find my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/vishruthdevan/). I'm also an AWS Certified Solutions Architect. I'm currently learning about LLMs and building WebAssembly projects.
