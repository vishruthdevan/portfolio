I'm Vishruth. I live in Coonoor, India.

I work as a Web Developer and a DevOps Engineer at [GoPlus Inc.](https://go-plus.io/) We are building an AI powered learning platform for higher education institutions.

I study Computer Science and Engineering at [VIT, Vellore](https://vit.ac.in/). I plan on doing my masters once undergrad ends.

I code. You can find my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/vishruthdevan/). I'm also an AWS Certified Solutions Architect. I'm currently learning about LLMs and building WebAssembly projects.
