I'm Vishruth. I live in New York.

I am doing my master's in Computer Science at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I did my bachelor's at [VIT, Vellore](https://vit.ac.in/).

I used to work as a Web Developer and a DevOps Engineer at [GoPlus Inc.](https://go-plus.io/) We were building an AI powered learning platform for higher education institutions.

I code. You can find my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/vishruthdevan/). I'm also an AWS Certified Solutions Architect. I'm currently researching on attention and building multi-agent systems with LLMs.
