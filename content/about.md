I'm Vishruth.

I live in New York now, but I used to live in Coonoor. I also spent time in Coimbatore, though Coonoor will always be home.

I graduated with a master's in Computer Science from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I completed my bachelor's at [VIT, Vellore](https://vit.ac.in/).

I'm a Software Engineer at [Juniper Square](https://junipersquare.com/), where I work on the agent memory service for our agents, the agent user interface, and more recently, complex financial reporting for private markets. I was also part of the CRIS Lab and was a summer research fellow at the NLP Lab at Columbia. Before this, I worked as a Web Developer and DevOps Engineer at [Go Plus](https://go-plus.io/), where we built an AI-powered learning platform for higher education institutions.

I code, and you can find my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/vishruthdevan/). I'm also an AWS Certified Solutions Architect.
